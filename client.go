Source allows you to add locale content or path to it.
Multiple calls are allowed or you can pass all arguments into one call.

        Source(<content1>)                                   // (1)
        Source(<content2>)                                   // (2)

is the same as

        Source(<content1>, <content2>)                       // (3)

You can even combine the arrays of content and single data.

        Source(<content1>, []{<content2>, <content3>})       // (4)

As you noticed, the examples above written at the near Golang pseudocode.
That's because there is different entities may be used as locale source
depends on type of argument.

First thing first, all arguments are passed and combined into one single array.
Passed arrays also too.

Then the formed array's items are analysed independently,
the whole set of sources is generating, step by step,
moving forward to being ready to loaded by Load() call.

Argument's types and their meanings:
(Keep in mind, that ALL OTHER ARGUMENT TYPES which not listed below ARE PROHIBITED
and will lead to fast return error).

As we know from the above, there is only some "base" types and arrays are allowed.
Base types are:

 - string (treated as path to either locale's directory or locale's one file),
 - []byte (treated as the content of locale's file).

Adding arrays to the list above and we've also get:

 - []string (treated as the array of either locale's directories, files or even mixed),
 - [][]byte (treated as the array of locale's files content).

The passed paths are analyzed as soon as possible during this call
(thus you will get an error if path is not exist, access denied or something else)
but the content will not be loaded until Load() call.
Also for passed []byte (or [][]byte).

Keep in mind, Load() call flushes all pending sources.
Thus you will need to re-register sources you want to use as source again
after Load() call,
if you need to call Load() more than one times (dunno why you even need that).

Path to directory or file might be absolute or relative.
If relative it will converted to absolutely starting from the current work directory.

You may provide path to directory that contains sub-directories.
In that case all these sub-directories will be scanned too recursively,
till locale files found.

LC returns the requested Locale by its name.
